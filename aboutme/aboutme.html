    <p>Hi, I'm Elena, a 16 year old from Italy. I'm trying to learn too many things at once and I get burned out too soon.
    <br>I'm learning cybersecurity, web development and game development. 
        Not at the same time, of course. Some months I'm focused on one thing, other months I'm focused on something else
    </p></div>

    <p>I love 2D pixel art games and 3D stylized games but playing them, at the moment, hurts a bit
        because I know I can't recreate the easiest of them. <br>
        I was always fascinated by those hacking videos that showed a computer with a green text "Loading..." and then "Hacked".
        10 year old me would probably be disappointed to know that it doesn't work like this
    </p>

        I would also love to learn things like AI or robotics, not for a deep reason, they just look cool tbh

        I hope I'll make original websites. They don't have to be "better" than others just "mine". At the moment, I'm writing this 
        and I know that this webpage is not amazing yet, but at least I stopped overthinking, waiting for the perfect moment and started making something
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <p>
        This website will change whenever I learn something new or just feel like it so 
        don't be surprised if I just switch theme, add somethings new, or delete something else
