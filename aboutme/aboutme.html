            <p>Hi, I'm Elena, a 16 year old from Italy. I'm curious about many things, maybe too many and sometimes I burn out.
            <br>I'm learning cybersecurity, web development and game development. 
            Not at the same time, of course. Some months I'm focused on one thing, other months I'm focused on something else

            <p>I love 2D pixel art games and 3D stylized games but playing them can be a little painful right now,
                 because I know I can't recreate even the simplest ones yet, but they're also what motivates me to keep learning. <br>
            I was always fascinated by those hacking videos that showed a computer with a green text "Loading..." and then "Hacked".
            10 year old me would probably be disappointed to know that it doesn't work like this. I'm still fascinated though

            I hope I'll make original websites. They don't have to be "better" than others just "mine".
            This website isn't amazing yet, but I stopped waiting for the perfect moment and started building something anyways

            <p>
            This website will change whenever I learn something new or just want to experiment so 
            don't be surprised if I just switch theme, add somethings new, or delete something else
