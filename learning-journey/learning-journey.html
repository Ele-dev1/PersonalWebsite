            <p>I used for the first time a phone that could access the Internet so I started downloading
                a few games. I remember using to wonder how they were made. I promised myself I would
                become a game developer

                I started searching for easy ways to make games. I found an app that required no coding knowledge;
                I don't remember well but I think I've spent more time fantasizing about making games then actually 
                making one...I was excited, just not very consistent, yet

                I casually found an app to learn web development, I didn't mean to but I downloaded it as soon as I saw it.
                Web development also fascinated me: it's a wonderful way to reach as many people as possibile from any contry, 
                from any device. <br>
                Spent too much time (a few months) copying code thinking that was the right way to learn. Eventually I tried to
                code on VS code couldn't do anythings: I was only learning the syntax but I didn't know how to use it. I got 
                annoyed and stepped away for a while

                I got into game development. I had no idea where to start but I chose Unreal Engine. Everyone said it was very
                complex so in my head complex = I can do more things. After a few tutorials, trying not to get in a tutorial hell,
                I managed to make my first game. I published it in June 2024 on Itch. I have to admit it wasn't amazing, nobody dowloaded it
                but, but at least it was my first finished project
            </p>

            <p>
                I started to make a new game but I quickly realized that complex doesn't mean "better". I want to make 2D and 3D stylized games
                not photorealistic ones so Unreal Engine was not the right fit for me. I quit that project

                This year I decided to switch to Godot for game dev and started to learn game dev with The Odin Project. I also
                accidentally began to love cybersecurity, all because of the first room of tryhackme.
